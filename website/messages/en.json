    "post1Title": "How to Start Working Out: A Complete Beginner's Guide",
    "post1Excerpt": "Everything you need to know before your first gym visit — from choosing a program to proper form and progression.",
    "post1Content1": "Starting to work out can be intimidating, especially if you've never been to a gym before. A good plan, realistic expectations, and understanding basic training principles are the keys to success. In this article, I'll walk you through everything you need to know.",
    "post1Content2": "## Choosing a Program\n\nThe most important thing for beginners is consistency, not a perfect program. I recommend full body training 3 times per week, focusing on compound movements: squat, deadlift, bench press, rowing, and overhead press. These exercises engage the most muscle groups and give the best results for time invested.",
    "post1Content3": "## Progressive Overload\n\nThe key to progress is gradually increasing the load. Start with weights you can control with proper form. Every week, try to add a little weight or reps. This principle, known as progressive overload, is the foundation of every successful program.",
    "post1Content4": "## Recovery and Nutrition\n\nTraining is just the stimulus — growth happens during recovery. Sleep at least 7-8 hours, consume enough protein (1.6-2.2g/kg body weight), and stay hydrated. Without proper recovery, even the best program won't deliver results.",
    "post2Title": "Protein: The Complete Guide — How Much, When, and Which",
    "post2Excerpt": "Everything about protein — daily needs, timing, sources, and whether you really need a supplement.",
    "post2Content1": "Protein is the foundation of muscle building and recovery. Whether your goal is hypertrophy, fat loss, or improving athletic performance, adequate protein intake is crucial. But how much is really enough?",
    "post2Content2": "## Daily Needs\n\nFor active individuals who weight train, the optimal intake is 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. An 80kg person needs to consume 128-176g of protein daily. This sounds like a lot, but with good meal planning it's entirely achievable.",
    "post2Content3": "## Protein Timing\n\nThe myth of the 30-minute \"anabolic window\" after training is largely outdated. Much more important is the total daily intake and even distribution of protein across meals. Aim for 30-50g of protein per meal, spread across 3-5 meals per day.",
    "post2Content4": "## Food vs. Supplements\n\nIt's always better to prioritize protein from food: chicken, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes. Whey protein is useful as a supplement when it's hard to reach daily intake through food alone, but it's not necessary. A quality nutrition plan can cover all your needs.",
    "post3Title": "Why Sleep Is Key to Fitness Results",
    "post3Excerpt": "How quality sleep directly affects muscle growth, fat loss, and athletic performance.",
    "post3Content1": "Sleep is one of the most neglected factors in fitness. During deep sleep, the body secretes growth hormone, repairs muscle fibers, and consolidates motor patterns learned during training. Cutting sleep can undo all the effort put in at the gym.",
    "post3Content2": "## Impact on Hormones\n\nStudies show that just one week of restricted sleep (5-6 hours) can reduce testosterone levels by 10-15% and increase cortisol levels. This directly affects the ability to build muscle and lose fat. The goal is 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night.",
    "post3Content3": "## Practical Tips\n\nStick to a consistent sleep schedule. Avoid screens 1 hour before bed. Keep the room dark and cool (18-20°C). Avoid caffeine after 2pm. These simple changes can drastically improve sleep quality and thus your fitness results.",
    "post4Title": "How to Lose Fat Without Losing Muscle",
    "post4Excerpt": "Strategies for effective fat loss while preserving hard-earned muscle mass.",
    "post4Content1": "One of the biggest challenges in fitness is losing body fat without losing muscle. Too aggressive a calorie deficit, insufficient protein intake, and neglecting strength training are the most common mistakes that lead to muscle loss during a diet.",
    "post4Content2": "## Moderate Calorie Deficit\n\nThe optimal deficit is 300-500 calories per day, resulting in a loss of 0.5-1kg per week. More aggressive deficits (1000+ calories) often lead to muscle loss, reduced metabolism, and increased risk of the \"yo-yo\" effect. Patience is key.",
    "post4Content3": "## Strength Training Is Mandatory\n\nDuring a deficit, strength training sends the body a signal that muscles are needed and shouldn't be used as an energy source. Maintain training intensity (weight on the bar), but reduce total volume by 20-30% if needed. Never switch to a cardio-only program.",
    "post4Content4": "## High Protein Intake\n\nDuring a deficit phase, protein needs are higher than during maintenance or bulking. I recommend 2.0-2.4g/kg body weight. Protein helps preserve muscle, reduces hunger, and has a high thermic effect (the body uses energy to digest it)."
